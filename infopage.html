        <h3 style="text-align: center;">The SHRUB and The Tool Library</h3>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;">The SHRUB</h4>

        <p>"The Shrub Swap and Reuse Hub is Edinburgh’s hub for creative reuse. In 4 years it’s grown from an idea into an exciting community hub for sustainable living.
        Every September, freshers at the University of Edinburgh can collect, for free, all the stuff left behind by previous graduate students. This project, and the cooperative behind it, shows the crucial role of young people in fighting climate change.
        <br>
        Several years, a group of students at the University of Edinburgh noticed that when students moved out of halls of residence, they would often leave behind items which they could not carry or felt no use for anymore. All of this used to end up in the bin, headed for landfill. A few months later, new students would buy new materials which would end up in the bin at the end of the year." <a href="https://www.shrubcoop.org/">Read more here</a>

        <h4 style="text-align: center;">The Tool Library</h4>
        <p>"The story of the Edinburgh Tool Library began in the summer of 2013, when I was visited by a friend from Toronto. While chatting about social enterprise, she told me about a her home town’s new tool library, which lent out equipment to it’s members. I thought this was a great idea and made so much sense, so I started looking into it. Emails were exchanged with the Toronto Tool Library and arrangements were made for my return visit to Toronto the following October." <a href="https://edinburghtoollibrary.org.uk/">Read more here</a>
